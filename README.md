# Etch-a-Sketch

A JavaScript implementation of Etch-a-Sketch. Creates a grid of divs that react to mouseenter events to change the colour of the Divs.
Has options to draw in black, random colours or to darken the current colour of the div on each mouseenter event until the div is black.

The default generated grid is 16 x 16 divs, but a grid of up to 100 x 100 divs can be created by choosing the Resize grid option.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

Creating this project allowed me to practice using many of the Javascript fundamentals as well as DOM manipulation and the use of Event Listeners.
